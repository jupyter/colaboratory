/**
 *
 * @fileoverview Client IDs for Google API Access.
 *
 * Client IDs are created in the Google Cloud Console, and are used to access
 * Google APIs.  In this case, the Google Drive API is main API being accessed.
 *
 * Client IDs interact with API usage in a number of ways, in particlar:
 *
 *  - All client IDs belong to a cloud console project
 *
 *  - The realtime API uses the client ID to determine which apps can use the
 *    same realtime document.  So apps using different client IDs cannot access
 *    the same realtime document.
 *
 *  - The drive.install OAuth scope installs an app on Google Drive, so that
 *    users can open or create documents from the Google Drive website.  Each
 *    app is configured at the project level, so that each Cloud Console project
 *    corresponds to a single app.
 *
 *  - Chrome Apps can only have one Client ID, and this is a special kind of
 *    client ID that can only be used by Chrome Apps.
 *
 * Because of the above constraints, we must set up client IDs in a very
 * specific manner.  See below for more info.
 *
 * Since all apps (Chrome App and Web App) must be able to share the same
 * realtime document, there must be some cloud console project that contains
 * client IDs for both the Chrome App and the web App.  These are the client
 * IDs colab.client_id.DRIVE_CLIENT_ID, and the client ID listed in the Chrome
 * App manifest colaboratory/chrome/manifest.json.
 *
 * Since Chrome Apps have a single client ID, the Chrome App must use this
 * client ID to install on Drive.  In order to be installed on Drive as a
 * different app (so people can choose whether to open a file in the webapp or
 * the Chrome app), the web app must then use a different client ID, which
 * belongs to a separate cloud console project, to install itself to drive.
 * This is the colab.client_id.INSTALL_CLIENT_ID.
 *
 * Finally, int addition to the drive.install scope, which is used by the webapp
 * to install itself, the welcome screen also requires the
 * drive.readonly.metadata scope, to allow for the "open" dialog in the welcome
 * screen.  This is not strictly necessary since we could switch to the
 * DRIVE_CLIENT_ID when opeining the "open" dialog.  But this isn't
 * implemented in the code yet.
